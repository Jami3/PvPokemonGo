Notes for playing PVP in Pokemon go

## Fast Moves

Note that all fast moves can be looked up [here on PvPoke](https://pvpoke.com/moves/fast/)

Fast moves are the moves that are used when you are tapping on your screen.

There are 3 main archetypes of fast moves for PVP and they are:
- Fast Charge (These are high EPT or Energy Per Turn moves)
- Heavy Damage (These are high DPT or Damage Per Turn moves)
- Balanced / Multipurpose (These are a more balanced hybrid of Energy and Damage per turn)

The most common archetypes you will see in almost every single battle are Fast Charge, and Balanced / Multipurpose. Heavy damage moves are usually fairly niche

Each archetype is mostly self explanatory but lets get a bit more detailed on each.
#### Fast Charge
This type of fast move is used for Pokemon who are primarily doing their damage through **charge** moves. Their fast attack is optimized to maximize their energy gain. Because of this their fast attack is usually not a source of substantial damage.

Examples of popular fast charge fast moves are:
- Umbreon's "Snarl"
- Swampert's "Mudshot"
- Registeel's "Lock On"

#### Heavy Damage
This type of fast move is used for Pokemon who are primarily doing their damage through fast attacks. Because of this damage optimization they are usually very slow to charge energy for their charged attacks.

Examples of popular heavy damage fast moves are:
- Wigglytuff's "Charm"
- Bastiodon's "Smackdown"
- Victreebel's "Razor Leaf"

#### Balanced / Multipurpose
This type of fast move is for anything that is a balance of damage and energy gain. Some moves lean more towards damage but still give good energy, and vice-versa.

Examples of popular balanced / multipurpose fast moves are:
- Machamp's "Counter"
- Skarmory's "Steel wing" or "Air Slash"
- Gengar's "Shadow Claw"



## Charge Moves
Note that all fast moves can be found [here on PvPoke](https://pvpoke.com/moves/charged/)

Charge moves are the moves that you spend energy on and then swipe furiously to collect all of their orbs.

I will list and explain the most common terminology used on PVPoke when it comes to charge moves:
- Spam/Bait
- Nuke
- Coverage
- Debuff
- Boost

For simplicity sake, and in most cases early on team building, you usually want 1 charged move that is a **Spam/Bait**, and 1 charged move that is either a **Nuke** or **Coverage**
#### Spam/Bait
This is a charge move that doesn't necessarily do a lot of damage, but has a very low energy requirement to use or "Spam" the skill.

Examples of Spam/Bait charge moves are:
- Umbreon's "Foul Play"
- Raichu's "Thunder Punch"
- Alolan Marowak's "Bone Club"
- Whiscash's "Mud bomb"

In the [list of charged moves](https://pvpoke.com/moves/charged/) these are usually moves that require 40 or less energy.

Note: This type of move is referred to as a "bait" in higher level play where it is common to store energy and pretend you are going to use a big damage skill, but instead use your low energy low damage skill to "bait" your opponent to use up a shield.

#### Nuke
This is a charge move that is essentially a "big damage" move, and is a great complimentary move to a Spam/Bait charge move.

Examples of Nuke charge moves are:
- Alolan Muk's "Gunk Shot"
- Azumaril's "Hydro Pump"
- Typhlosion's "Blast Burn"

In the [list of charged moves](https://pvpoke.com/moves/charged/) these are usually moves that deal 100 or more damage.
#### Coverage
A Coverage move does not refer to a move's damage or energy at all, it is in reference to the Pokemon Type System, and provides "coverage" to a different type.

For example, if you have a water pokemon, that has a water charge move, you may want to consider also running an ice move, since ice is a type that is strong / neutral to the types that water is weak against.

#### Debuff (WIP)
This is a charge move that inflicts something other than damage on the opposing pokemon.
#### Boost (WIP)
